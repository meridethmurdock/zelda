   <p>Fairy rudely wakes you up, calls you lazy, and begs you to save the world by talking to a tree.</p>

<h1>Step 2:</h1>
    <p>Hrmph. No pass for you.</p>

<h1>Step 3:</h1>
    <p>Avoid the rock and get the sword.</p> 
    <p>No…. not that rock. Go in that hole in the tree and avoid the giant moving rock.</p>
    <p>Yes, that rock. Awesome.</p> 
    <p>Da da da DAAAAAAA.</p>
    <p>I got a sword. I got a sword. I got a sword hey hey hey hey.</p>

<h1>Step 4:</h1>
    <p>Make that money by stealing from people across town. Then buy a shield from the person you stole from.</p>

<h1>Step 5:</h1>
    <p>To the tree!!! </p>
    <p>Just kidding. Kill a plant. Then go to the tree.</p>
    <p>After some brief (yes, 5 minutes is brief) dialogue, you will be able to enter the tree, but only if you say “Yes” (which you have to. There are no choices in this game. Only the illusion of choice).</p>
    <p>Wait… who are you?</p> 

<h1>Step 6:</h1>
    <p>Finally! Uninterrupted exploration and getting to play the game!</p>
    <p>WE GET IT. “A” IS IMPORTANT OMFG NAVI I CANNOT WITH YOUR</p>

<h1>Step 7:</h1>
    <p>No, Link!! Don’t actually jump, she gets better later in the game! (I’m lying, but seriously we need you alive)</p>
    <p>Oh.. you’re fine. Cool. Nevermind.</p> 

<h1>Step 8:</h1>
    <p>THIS WEB IS ON FIIIIIRE </p>

<h1>Step 9:</h1>
    <p>23 is #1. Well, actually. No one likes you when you’re 23, so they probably should have thought that one through. I’m sure it’s fine.</p>

<h1>Step 10:</h1>
    <p>More fire and falling to your death.</p>

<h1>Step 11:</h1>
    <p>Wow. You actually have to hit them in order. How annoying.</p>

<h1>Step 12:</h1>
    <p>GIANT EYEBALL SPIDER OMG WHAT ARE YOU I’M GONNA DIE I’M GONNA DIE</p>
    <p>Oh.. that was like.. 7 seconds. Okay. Cool.</p>

<h1>Step 13:</h1>
    <p>They turned into a heart.</p>
    <p>K, thx, bai!</p>

<h1>Step 14: </h1>
    <p>The history lesson you did not sign up for.</p>

<h1>Step 15: </h1>
    <p>FINALLY. I got the emerald, the tree unfortunately died, but I survived 20 minutes of story and I am off to see the world without interruptions forreal this time.</p>
